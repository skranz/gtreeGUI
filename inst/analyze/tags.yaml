perfect_info:
  requires: tg
  descr: |
    Do we have a game with perfect information?
    We check it by testing whether all information sets are singletons.

    Note that moves of nature after actions are allowed. We could rewrite
    the game in an equivalent fashion and put the moves of nature before the actions,
    but make them unobservable. The game would then, however, be classified
    as a game with imperfect information.
sim_move:
  requires: tg
  descr: |
    Do we have a simultaneous move game?
    We need at least two players that can perform actions. Each player shall have only
    one information set. If a player takes multiple actions in a stage this counts only
    as a single information set (need to implement this feature).
    A sequential game that uses a strategy method is not classified as a simultaneous move
    game. One can search for strategy method separately.

has_multi_actions:
  requires: tg
  descr: |
    Has at least one player more than one action variable?

num_variants:
  requires: rg
  descr: |
    The number of variants of this particular gameId.

num_players:
  requires: rg
  descr: |
    The number of players.

num_action_players:
  requires: tg
  descr: |
    The number of players that possible can take an action.

has_passive_players:
  requires: tg
  descr: |
    Is there at least one player, who can never take an action?

dictator_like:
  default: FALSE
  requires: tg
  descr: |
    Only computed if there is one action player and at least one passive players.
    If passive players don't have a fixed payoff, we mark it as
    dictator like. (We need to improve the classification and remove games
    in which payoffs only vary due to moves of nature). This classification
    also includes third party dictator games and games in which the dictator
    cannot influence her own payoff.

has_chatbox:
  default: FALSE
  descr: |
    Does some variant use a chatbox addin?
